## 📌 Project Overview

This analysis focuses on identifying patterns in shipping delays and customer behavior in an e-commerce setting. The goal is to help logistics teams optimize delivery strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical shipping records with attributes like:

- **Shipping Mode:** Road, Ship, or Flight
- **Discount Offered**
- **Delivery Status:** On time or Delayed
- **Product Importance & Priority**
- **Warehouse and Customer Location**
- **Customer Rating**
- **Customer Query Status**

File: `Train.csv`  
Rows: 10999 | Columns: 12

## ❓ Key Questions Explored

1. What percentage of shipments are delayed?
2. Which shipping mode has the highest delay rate (Road vs Ship vs Flight)?
3. Do higher discounts lead to more delivery delays?
4. Do high-priority products get delayed more or less?
5. Which warehouses have the most delivery delays?
6. What is the average customer rating, and does it relate to delivery status?
7. Are customer queries being answered?
8. If product importance is high, does it get delivered on time or receive better ratings?

## 📈 Visual Insights

The notebook contains visualizations such as:

- Bar charts showing delay percentages by shipping mode
- Scatter plots comparing discounts vs delays
- Grouped bar plots for priority and importance vs delays
- Customer ratings by delivery status
- Warehouse delay frequency charts
